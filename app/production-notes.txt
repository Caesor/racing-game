Cloned Chapter 7 model viewer, using to preview each model.
Nissan GTR OBJ - 
 - downloaded from turbosquid.
 - materials weren't showing up imported into Blender.
 - Tried simple convert using Three.js OBJ converter, materials still didn't show up
 - Problem was spaces in file names in .MTL (material) file e.g. 'Nissan OBJ.js'; I took out spaces and materials worked.
 - Converted to JS, couldn't see texture
 - (edited JS file) Changed diffuse color of materials from black to white, textures showed up
 - (edited JS file) Added blue specular to car body for pop
 
 Muscle Car -
  - no materials or textures present. might complain to turbosquid
  
 Camaro -
  - downloaded from turbosquid, no materials in the file, had to chat with support.
  - they sent me updated model. noted that pivot point (origin) is at front of car instead of center,
    and off-center in X dimension too


 Nova Car (OBJ)
  - fixed spaces in material file name
  - fixed spaces in texture file names, also a problem
  - converted Targa texture files to JPEG
  - loaded in model previewer, noted that pivot point (origin) is at front of car instead of center
  
 Hatchback (OBJ)
  - came in two pieces
  - needed to convert BMP to JPG
  - needed to hack double-sided for the wheel
  
A lot of the models don't have anything underneath. That's ok, only our main one needs to.
